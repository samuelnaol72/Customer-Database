Assignment Number: 3

Assignment Overview:
  This assignment provided me an in-depth practice on struct data types, hash table implementations and dynamic memory
  management. It took me about 72 hours to complete the assignment. I think, the tasks are well-aligned with the topics
  that were convered during the lecture. So, it was a very good experience doing the assignment!
  
Array Vs Hash Table Implementations: 
  The array-based implementation is straightforward as we directly store the object itself. However, it takes longer time
  to manipulate the user information and it's even worse when the number of users is too large. On the other hand, Hash tables 
  offer significant efficiency improvements, allowing for fast data manipulation even with large datasets. Operations that take
  considerable time with arrays implementation can be executed in fractions of a second with hash tables. However, the memory man
  agement and designing a good hash function is quite challenging in this case.
   
Extra Credit: 
  To get extra credit, I have implemented the hash table expansion in the RegisterCustomer function within customer_management2.c. 

Collaborations: 
  I received valuable support through campuswire discussions. TAs were very helpful!
